# Postmortem

## Issue Summary:

- Duration: February 10, 2024, 9:00 AM - February 11, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC)
- Impact: The primary service affected was our web application, resulting in intermittent downtime and slow performance for approximately 60% of our users.
- Root Cause: A misconfigured caching layer caused a bottleneck in our database queries, leading to degraded performance and occasional service outages.

## Timeline:

- 9:00 AM (UTC): Issue detected via monitoring alerts indicating increased latency and error rates.
- 9:15 AM: Engineers started investigating potential causes, initially suspecting network issues.
- 10:00 AM: Misleading assumption made about a recent code deployment causing the problem, leading to unnecessary rollback attempts.
- 11:30 AM: Escalation to database team after ruling out network and code deployment issues.
- 12:30 PM: Database team identified the misconfigured caching layer as the root cause.
- 1:00 PM: Immediate action taken to disable the faulty caching layer.
- 2:00 PM: Service performance gradually improved as the caching layer was disabled.
- 2:00 PM: Incident declared resolved as service stability returned to normal.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

- Root Cause: A misconfigured caching layer caused excessive database queries, creating a bottleneck and slowing down the application.
- Resolution: The faulty caching layer was disabled, immediately alleviating the strain on the database and restoring service performance.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- Improvements/Fixes:
  - Review and update caching configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
  - Implement stricter monitoring of database query performance to detect anomalies early.
  - Enhance communication channels for faster incident escalation and resolution.

- Tasks:
  1. Review and update caching configurations to ensure optimal performance.
  2. Implement additional monitoring checks for database query latency and cache utilization.
  3. Conduct a post-incident review with all relevant teams to identify additional areas for improvement.
  4. Update incident response procedures to streamline escalation and resolution processes.
  5. Schedule regular audits of critical system configurations to catch misconfigurations early.
